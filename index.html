    <p> I created a Favicon by using the Excel sheet and used the color bucket to fill in the places I wanted. The bits were 32 by 32 with white pixels you can color in and bordered with a Black line. I was inspired by a shushi image from Google and decided to recreate it. After I finished, I went to the file and downloaded it as a PDF.</p> 
<br>
    <p> But since we cannot add PDF, I had to take a screenshot and add a new file here. To add the favicon I used the code "link/ rel=" icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico", adding the open/close angle brackets. That's how I was able to add my Favicon to this web page.</p>
